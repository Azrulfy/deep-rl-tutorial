# A Tutorial Series on Deep Reinforcement Learning
## Author: Robert Tjarko Lange (ECN Berlin)

This repository contains a series of tutorials on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This includes slides as well as experiments. Going forward I plan on adding exercises as well as complementary blog posts.

### Deep Q-Learning

* [Slides](Deep_Q_Learning.key): Includes DQN, Double DQN, Prioritized Experience Replay & Dueling DQNs
* [Experiments](EXPERIMENTS_DQL): Provides code to implement all of the above.

### Deep Policy Gradients (to be continued)
